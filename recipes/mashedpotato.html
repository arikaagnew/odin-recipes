    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>This is an easy take on mashed potatoes that uses
        an Instant Pot. The Instant Pot will pressure cook the potatoes
        while you focus on other things. This recipe is super basic but
        very tasty and can be updated with your own favorite ingredients.
