   <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Corn Cake is a quick and easy recipe with only a few ingredients.
    making it a budget friendly dish. Corn cake is moist, buttery, 
    and so delicious. Corn cake can be a side to most meals and is a 
    favorite with chili in my house. Corn cake is quick
    which is great for the busiest parent around. Add jalepenos to
    your corn cake for a little bit of added flavor and heat.</p>
